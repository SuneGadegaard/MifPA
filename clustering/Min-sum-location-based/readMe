This folder contains code for performing clustering on a dataset.
The code uses a data-file format consisting of (x,y)-coordinates of data points, but it can easily be changed to performing clustering on any type of data
where a measure of distance between data-points is given in a n x n (d_ij) matrix, where d_ij denotes the "distance" between data point i and j.
The only assumptions on the d_ij matrix are that d_ii=0 and d_ij>=0 for all i and j.

The clustering is perfomed using an integer programming (IP) model identical to the p-median problem:
min   sum ( i in 0..n-1 ) sum ( i in 0..n-1 ) d[i][j]*x[i][j]
s.t.: sum ( i in 0..n-1 ) x[i][j] == 1,   for all j=0..n-1
      x[i][j] <= y[i],                    for all i,j=0..n
      sum ( i in 0..n-1 ) y[i] <= k,
      x[i][j] and y[i] all binary

The IP is modelled using Pyomo and then solved usin an IP solver. The code suggests glpk, but any IP solver goes.

The code as it is relies on libraries
1. Pyomo
2. Matplotloi
3. Math
And then the code in readAndWriteJson is used to read the data from a Json-formattet file.

After the IP i solved, the displaySolution-function is called which plots the solution for visual inspection
