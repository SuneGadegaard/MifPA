This folder contains a small example showing how to perform a k-means cluster analysis on a small 2D example
The data in clusteringData_34_point is stored in a Json file with the following lay-out
"x": x-coordinates of the points
"y": y-coordinates of the points
"k": number of clusters 

The code snippet uses sklearn library and its k-means algorithm. After clustering the data, matplotlib is used to plot the data as a scatter plot
for visual inspection.
