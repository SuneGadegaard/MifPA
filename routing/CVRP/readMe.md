The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is problem, which has been extensively studied in the operations research literature. 
For that reasone, there is a myrid of formulations for the problem proposed in the literature. To understand the relationship between some of these
formulations, the paper "[Projection results for vehicle routing](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-005-0652-x)" 
by A.N. Letchfor and J.J. Salazar-Gonz√°lez (2006) may be of interest.

For a library containing many of the instances used in the literature, please see the [CVRPLIB](http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/).
